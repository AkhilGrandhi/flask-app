# Resume Generation Integration - Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed & Implemented

### 1. **Fixed `candidateresumebuilder.py`**
   - ✅ **Converted to Blueprint**: Changed from standalone Flask app to a proper Blueprint
   - ✅ **Removed duplicate imports**: Cleaned up duplicate imports (Document, os, BytesIO, WD_PARAGRAPH_ALIGNMENT)
   - ✅ **Created proper API route**: `@bp.post("/generate")` - now accessible via API
   - ✅ **Fixed function signature**: `generate_resume()` now properly gets data from request
   - ✅ **Focused on Word generation**: PDF generation marked as "not yet implemented"
   - ✅ **Fixed security**: API key now uses environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### 2. **Registered Resume Blueprint**
   - ✅ Added `candidateresumebuilder` blueprint to `backend/app/__init__.py`
   - ✅ Registered at route: `/api/resume/generate`

### 3. **Frontend Integration**
   - ✅ Added `generateResume()` function to `frontend/src/api.js`
   - ✅ Updated `CandidateDetail.jsx`:
     - Added resume generation when adding job
     - Added loading state with spinner
     - Added auto-download functionality
     - Made Job Description field multiline
     - Added helpful instructions for users

## 🚀 How It Works

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/resume/generate
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "job_desc": "Job description text...",
  "candidate_info": "Candidate information formatted as text...",
  "file_type": "word"
}
```

**Response:**
- Returns a Word document (`.docx`) file as a download

---

## 📋 User Flow

1. **Navigate to Candidate Detail Page**
   - Go to your dashboard
   - Click on a candidate

2. **Add Job & Generate Resume**
   - Enter **Job ID** (e.g., "JD-12345")
   - Enter **Job Description** (paste the full job description)
   - Click **"Add & Generate"**

3. **System Actions (Automatic)**
   - ✅ Saves the job to the candidate's record
   - ✅ Formats candidate information
   - ✅ Calls OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to generate tailored resume
   - ✅ Creates a Word document
   - ✅ Automatically downloads: `FirstName_LastName_Resume.docx`

4. **Loading State**
   - Button shows "Generating..." with spinner
   - All fields disabled during generation
   - Takes 15-30 seconds depending on resume complexity

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### 1. **Environment Variable**
You MUST set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

**Windows:**
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
```

### 2. **Python Dependencies**
Make sure these are installed:
```bash
pip install python-docx openai flask flask-cors
```

### 3. **Restart Flask Server**
After setting the environment variable, restart your Flask backend:
```bash
cd backend
flask run
# or
python wsgi.py
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- ⚠️ **NEVER commit API keys to git!**
- ✅ Always use environment variables for API keys
- ✅ The code now uses `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")`

### Resume Generation
- 🤖 Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model
- 📄 Generates 2+ page ATS-optimized resumes
- ⏱️ Takes 15-30 seconds to generate
- 💰 Costs ~$0.02-0.05 per resume (depending on length)

### File Format
- ✅ **Word (.docx)**: Fully implemented
- ❌ **PDF**: Not yet implemented (returns 501 error)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the API Directly (Optional)
You can test the endpoint with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resume/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_desc": "We need a Python developer...",
    "candidate_info": "Name: John Doe\nSkills: Python, Django...",
    "file_type": "word"
  }' \
  --output test_resume.docx
```

### Test via Frontend
1. Start both backend and frontend
2. Login as a user
3. Navigate to a candidate
4. Add a job with description
5. Click "Add & Generate"
6. Check downloads folder for `.docx` file

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing OPENAI_API_KEY"
- **Fix**: Set the environment variable and restart Flask

### Error: "Resume generation failed: Empty response from AI"
- **Cause**: OpenAI API issue or invalid API key
- **Fix**: Verify API key is correct and has credits

### Error: "Invalid JSON"
- **Cause**: Request body format issue
- **Fix**: Check that job_desc and candidate_info are provided

### Download doesn't start
- **Check**: Browser console for errors
- **Check**: Network tab to see if API returned 200 status
- **Check**: Pop-up blocker isn't blocking download

## 📊 What Gets Generated

The resume includes:
1. **Candidate Name** (centered, bold, large)
2. **Contact Info** (email, phone, location)
3. **Professional Summary** (6-8 bullet points)
4. **Technical Skills** (15-20 categorized subsections)
5. **Work Experience** (10-15 bullet points per job)
6. **Certifications**
7. **Education**

All tailored to the specific job description!
