# Render SPA Routing Fix

## Problem
When you refresh a page on a route like `/recruiter`, Render returns a 404 "Not Found" error. This happens because the server tries to find a file at that path instead of serving your React app's `index.html`.

## Solution

### Option 1: Using Render Dashboard (Recommended - Quick Fix)

1. Go to your Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select your frontend static site (`flask-app-frontend-dev`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Redirects/Rewrites**
4. Add the following rewrite rule:
   - **Source**: `/*`
   - **Destination**: `/index.html`
   - **Status**: `200` (Rewrite)
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Render will automatically redeploy your site

### Option 2: Using _redirects File (Already Configured)

The `_redirects` file in `frontend/public/` has been fixed and should work automatically:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**To verify it's working:**
1. Rebuild your frontend on Render
2. After deployment, check if the `_redirects` file exists in your deployed static files
3. You can test by visiting: `https://your-app.onrender.com/_redirects`

### Option 3: Using render.yaml (Infrastructure as Code)

A `render.yaml` file has been created at the root of your project with the correct configuration. To use it:

1. Commit the `render.yaml` file to your repository
2. In Render Dashboard, go to **Blueprint** → **New Blueprint Instance**
3. Connect your repository
4. Render will automatically configure your services based on the YAML file

## Current Status

✅ Fixed: `frontend/public/_redirects` file (removed extra blank line)
✅ Created: `render.yaml` with proper SPA routing configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fix**: Use Option 1 (Dashboard method) - This is the fastest solution
2. **For Future**: Push the updated `_redirects` file and `render.yaml` to your repository
3. **Verify**: After deployment, test these routes:
   - `/recruiter` (should load the recruiter dashboard)
   - `/admin` (should load the admin dashboard)
   - `/candidate` (should load the candidate dashboard)
   - Refresh any of these pages (should not show 404)

## Why This Happens

Single Page Applications (SPAs) like your React app use client-side routing. When you:
- **Click links**: React Router handles navigation without making server requests ✅
- **Refresh or direct access**: Browser makes a server request, but the server doesn't know about React routes ❌

The solution tells the server: "For any path, serve `index.html` and let React Router handle it."

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists after applying the fix:

1. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check deployment logs**: Ensure the build completed successfully
3. **Verify _redirects**: Check if it exists in the deployed dist folder
4. **Check Render settings**: Make sure the "Publish Directory" is set to `./frontend/dist`
5. **Environment**: Ensure Node version is compatible (should be 18 or higher)

## Contact Support

If none of these solutions work, you may need to:
1. Check Render's documentation: https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app
