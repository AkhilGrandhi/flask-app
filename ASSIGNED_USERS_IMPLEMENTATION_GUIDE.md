# Assigned Users Feature - Implementation Complete! ✅

## Overview
This feature allows admins to assign multiple users to a candidate, enabling collaboration while maintaining the original creator information.

---

## 🎯 Feature Behavior

### **Admin Workflow:**

1. **Creating a Candidate:**
   - Select **one creator** (required) - who officially created the record
   - Select **multiple assigned users** (optional) - who can view/edit this candidate
   - Example:
     - Creator: User A
     - Assigned Users: User B, User C, User D
     - Result: Users A, B, C, D can all see and manage this candidate

2. **Editing a Candidate:**
   - Can change the creator
   - Can add/remove assigned users
   - Both fields are independent

### **Regular User Workflow:**

1. **Creating a Candidate:**
   - Creator is automatically set to the logged-in user
   - Cannot assign other users
   - Only they can see their created candidates (unless admin assigns others later)

2. **Viewing Candidates:**
   - See candidates they **created** (`created_by = self`)
   - See candidates they are **assigned to** (`self in assigned_users`)
   - Example: USER1 sees CD1 (assigned), CD2 (created), CD3 (created)

## 📊 Database Changes

### New Table: `candidate_assigned_users`

```sql
CREATE TABLE candidate_assigned_users (
    candidate_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    assigned_at DATETIME,
    PRIMARY KEY (candidate_id, user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY(candidate_id) REFERENCES candidate (id),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES user (id)
);
```

### Relationships Added:

```python
# User model
User.assigned_candidates  # Dynamic relationship to candidates assigned to this user

# Candidate model
Candidate.assigned_users  # Dynamic relationship to users assigned to this candidate
```

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### File: `backend/app/models.py`

**Added:**
- `candidate_assigned_users` junction table
- `User.assigned_candidates` relationship
- `Candidate.assigned_users` backref
- `assigned_users` array in `Candidate.to_dict()` response

### File: `backend/app/candidates.py`

**Modified Functions:**

1. **`owns_or_404()`** - Now checks if user is creator OR assigned
   ```python
   is_creator = cand.created_by_user_id == uid
   is_assigned = cand.assigned_users.filter_by(id=uid).first() is not None
   if not (is_creator or is_assigned):
       abort(404)
   ```

2. **`list_my_candidates()`** - Returns both created and assigned candidates
   ```python
   created_candidates = Candidate.query.filter_by(created_by_user_id=uid).all()
   assigned_candidates = user.assigned_candidates.all()
   # Merge and remove duplicates
   ```

3. **`create_candidate()`** - Handles `assigned_user_ids` (admin only)
   ```python
   if is_admin() and "assigned_user_ids" in data:
       for user_id in assigned_user_ids:
           user = User.query.get(user_id)
           if user and user.role == "user":
               c.assigned_users.append(user)
   ```

4. **`update_candidate()`** - Updates assigned users (admin only)

### File: `backend/app/admin.py`

**Modified:**
- `admin_update_candidate()` - Handles `assigned_user_ids` array

---

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### File: `frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`

**Added:**

1. **State:**
   ```javascript
   const [assignedUserIds, setAssignedUserIds] = useState([]);
   ```

2. **"Assigned Users" Field** (in dialog):
   - Multi-select Autocomplete
   - Shows all regular users
   - Displays selected users as chips
   - Only visible in admin panel

3. **"Assigned Users" Column** (in table):
   - Shows badges for each assigned user
   - Displays "None" if no assignments

**Updated:**
- `startAdd()` - Resets `assignedUserIds`
- `startEdit()` - Loads existing `assigned_users`
- `submit()` - Sends `assigned_user_ids` array to backend

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Run migration
flask db upgrade
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration

```bash
# Check if table was created
flask db current

# Should show: candidate_assigned_001 (head)
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
python wsgi.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Feature

1. **Login as Admin**
2. Go to **Candidates** tab
3. Click **"Add Candidate"**
4. Select a **Creator** (single user)
5. Select **Assigned Users** (multiple users)
6. Create the candidate
7. Verify in table: **Creator** and **Assigned Users** columns

### Step 5: Test User Access

1. **Logout as Admin**
2. **Login as assigned user** (e.g., USER1)
3. Check dashboard - should see the candidate
4. **Login as different user** (not assigned)
5. Should NOT see the candidate

## 📋 API Changes

### Request Format (Create/Update Candidate):

```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "created_by_user_id": 1,           // Creator (single user ID)
  "assigned_user_ids": [2, 3, 4],    // Assigned users (array of IDs)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Response Format (Get Candidates):

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "created_by": {                  // Original creator
        "id": 1,
        "email": "admin@example.com",
        "name": "Admin User"
      },
      "assigned_users": [              // Additional assigned users
        {
          "id": 2,
          "email": "user1@example.com",
          "name": "User One"
        },
        {
          "id": 3,

          "name": "User Two"
        }
      ],
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Admin Tests:
- [ ] Can create candidate with creator
- [ ] Can assign multiple users to candidate
- [ ] Can edit assigned users
- [ ] Can see both "Creator" and "Assigned Users" columns
- [ ] Assigned users show as colored badges

### User Tests:
- [ ] Can create candidate (auto-assigned as creator)
- [ ] Cannot see assignment fields
- [ ] Can see candidates they created
- [ ] Can see candidates they are assigned to
- [ ] Cannot see candidates they don't have access to

### Access Control Tests:

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Admin-Only Assignment:**
   - Only admins can assign users to candidates
   - Regular users cannot modify `assigned_user_ids`

2. **Creator Auto-Set:**
   - Regular users are automatically set as creator
   - Cannot change their creator ID

3. **Access Control:**
   - `owns_or_404()` checks creator OR assigned
   - Users can only see/edit candidates they have access to

4. **Role-Based:**
   - Only users with `role="user"` can be assigned
   - Admins are not added to assigned_users (they see all anyway)

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### Existing Data:
- ✅ All existing candidates retain their `created_by_user_id`
- ✅ `assigned_users` starts empty for existing records
- ✅ No data migration needed
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved

### Existing Queries:
- ✅ Users still see candidates they created
- ✅ New logic adds assigned candidates to the list
- ✅ No breaking changes to API

---

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Creates with Assignments

```
Admin (AG) creates CD1:
├─ Creator: AG
├─ Assigned Users: [USER1, USER2]
└─ Access:
    ✅ AG (creator + admin)
    ✅ USER1 (assigned)
    ✅ USER2 (assigned)
```

### Scenario 2: User Creates

```
USER1 creates CD2:
├─ Creator: USER1 (auto-set)
├─ Assigned Users: [] (empty)
└─ Access:
    ✅ USER1 (creator)
    ✅ Admin (sees all)
    ❌ USER2 (not assigned)
```

### Scenario 3: USER1's Dashboard

```
USER1 logs in and sees:
✅ CD1 (assigned by admin)
✅ CD2 (created by USER1)
✅ CD3 (created by USER1)
❌ CD4 (created by USER2, not assigned to USER1)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current head
flask db heads

# If multiple heads, update down_revision in migration file
# to match your latest migration ID
```

### Issue: Assigned users not showing
**Solution:**
- Check that `include_creator=True` is set in API call
- Verify migration ran successfully: `flask db current`
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Regular user sees assignment fields
**Solution:**
- Assignment fields should only show in Admin panel
- Verify user is logged in as admin
- Check role in JWT token
